# sentiment-analysis_BERT

Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis
This project performs sentiment analysis on Flipkart product reviews using a fine-tuned BERT model. Reviews are classified as either positive or negative based on user ratings. The project uses transformers and torch libraries for model implementation.

Project Overview:
The project is designed to classify user reviews as positive or negative based on the rating and review content. A BERT model (bert-base-uncased) is fine-tuned on this labeled data, with reviews rated 3 or above as positive and those rated 2 or below as negative.

Dataset:
This project uses the Flipkart Product Reviews dataset. Please download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naushads/flipkart-reviews and place it in the working directory with the name flipkart_reviews_dataset.csv.

Data Preprocessing:
Dataset Structure: The dataset contains the following columns:
product_id, product_title, rating, summary, review, location, date, upvotes, downvotes
Labeling: A label column is created:
Ratings >= 3 are labeled as 1 (Positive)
Ratings <= 2 are labeled as 0 (Negative)
Tokenization: BERTTokenizer is used to tokenize the reviews with padding and truncation to a max length of 128 tokens.

Model Training:
Model: BERTForSequenceClassification is initialized for binary classification.
Optimization: AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5.
DataLoader: TensorDataset and DataLoader split the dataset into training and validation sets with batch size 16.
Training Loop: The model is trained for 3 epochs with gradient clipping and a linear learning rate scheduler.

Evaluation:
After training, the model is evaluated on the validation set:
Accuracy: Overall accuracy on validation data is calculated.
Loss: Validation loss is computed.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix visualizes the modelâ€™s performance.
Prediction
A custom function predict_sentiment(review_text) predicts sentiment for individual reviews. The function:

Tokenizes input text
Generates prediction by passing tokenized data through the model
Returns 1 for positive sentiment and 0 for negative sentiment.

Results:
Validation Accuracy: 96.87%
Validation Loss: 0.134
Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix is plotted using seaborn for detailed performance visualization.

Setup and Installation:
1)Environment: Python 3.7 or later
2)Install Requirements
pip install pandas transformers torch sklearn matplotlib seaborn

Usage:
Training: Run the training loop to fine-tune the BERT model.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance on the validation set.
Prediction: Use predict_sentiment() function for individual review predictions.
